# <Readme_Generator>
Note: I am currently having internet connectivity issues at home. As such, I am using mobile data to assist to class. To save GBytes for class, I will refrain from using internet outside of class and will not be able to commit as often to this repo. I expect the issue to be resolved before next week.

## Description
This project will create a professional README.md file from the command line. This will allow me to have proper documentation while focusing my time in developing the applications I work on.
- Proper documentation is necessary for the iterability and maintenance of projects.
- Having an efficient way of generating proper documentation enables more time for the developing of applications.
